Project Description:
Build a Build Script. 
One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. 
Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private information that you don’t want to release in the published version.
In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a source directory into a build directory.
